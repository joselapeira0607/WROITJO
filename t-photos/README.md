## Who Are We?

We are JO SLD, a dynamic and passionate team proudly born from the classrooms of Jesús Obrero Technical Institute, an institution known for nurturing skilled professionals grounded in discipline, innovation, and teamwork. Our name carries the initials of our members—José, Keiner, and Mauricio—and represents our shared commitment to excellence in robotics and technology.

Our team is made up of:

- José Lapeira – High school graduate in Computer Science. A coding strategist with a keen eye for algorithmic logic and system structure. His precision is reflected in every line of code.

- Keiner Durán – Also a Computer Science graduate, he’s the integration specialist of the team. Always seeking ways to improve performance and synchronization between hardware and software components.

- Mauricio Sánchez – Electronics high school graduate and IT college technician (TSU). The electronics mastermind who balances circuit design with technical robustness and reliability.

At Jesús Obrero, we didn’t just learn theory—we embraced a way of thinking: with purpose, detail, and unity. Our mission is to represent our school, our community, and our country through projects that combine technology, creativity, and social impact.

Our motto: “From technique to impact” — because each prototype we build is our way of contributing to a smarter, better future.
